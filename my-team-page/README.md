- Where can I see your demo?

Check it [here](https://devchallenges-my-team.vercel.app/).

- What was your experience?

I made it while streaming (but I was falling asleep ðŸ˜‚). Redid the code the day after and it's 10 times better now ðŸ˜„.

- What have you learned/improved?

I've remembered (again) how to use correctly the flex properties (and some others like `gap` etc).

HTML5 & CSS3.
